This command reveals the version information about your Kommit therapist,
including their training date and certification level.

Just as you wouldn't trust your emotional well-being to an unqualified therapist,
your repository deserves a properly versioned commit message counselor.

Your therapist has been helping repositories express themselves meaningfully
since their certification date, and continues to grow with each update.`,
