	Use:   "cost",
	Short: "ðŸ’° Show the cost of your commitment therapy",
	Long: `ðŸ’° Kommit Cost Analysis - Because emotional growth has a price tag!

This command reveals how much your repository's therapy sessions have cost you so far.
Think of it as reviewing your therapy bills - a necessary part of the healing process.

Just as real therapy isn't free, AI-powered commit messages come with a cost.
Still, it's cheaper than the emotional damage of trying to decipher "fixed stuff"
six months from now when you're debugging at 3 AM.

Your wallet might need its own support group, but your future self will thank you
for the investment in clear, meaningful commit history.`,
